# JSON Schema Proposals Tests

The subfolders herein represent tests for each active proposal to the specification. If the proposal is a keyword (generally the case), then the subfolder will bear the name of that keyword. Inside the proposal subfolder is a series of test files that would contain amendments to the required test suite should the proposal be incorporated into the specification. These test should be considered volitile while the proposal is in development, however implementations claiming to support the proposal are expected to pass its tests.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This folder is NOT intended for proposed additions to the test suite or the specification.

Proposals to the test suite can be made by [opening an issue](https://github.com/json-schema-org/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite/issues/new) in this repository.

Proposals to the specification should be made by following the process defined by our [Feature Life Cycle](https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/blob/main/PROCESS.md#feature-life-cycle).
